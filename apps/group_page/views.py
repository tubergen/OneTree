Looks at the wall post that was potentially submitted and, if any data was
submitted, adds that data to the database. Returns an errorMsg if there was a
error, which can be rendered. Returns None otherwise.

Looks at request. If request specifies a post should be deleted / remmoved, then
it's deleted if the requester is the administrator of the author group; if not,
then the post is simply removed from the group's page. 

Don't forget to add authentication to this. Some permissions should be required
to be able to delete a post. 

I realize generally you make server-side changes with POST, not GET. However,
I see no reason to give the user a browser warning about "resubmission" here,
as would be the case with POST.

SPECIAL NOTE : if there's ever a bug where an event mysteriously appears on the
wall only when "[this page]'s Posts Only" is selected, and it cannot be deleted,
it might be because of the line "post = manager.get(id=post_id)". If somehow a
post managed to get deleted from its creater's wall without it being deleted
completely from the database, then this behavior will occur. I think this is
impossible now, but I'm not 100% sure.

We could patch this up by instead getting the post with Event.objects.get(id=...)
etc. for each type of post. However, I am not doing this right now because it
would hide a bigger issue: that posts which are deleted on the creater's wall
are not completely deleted from the database.

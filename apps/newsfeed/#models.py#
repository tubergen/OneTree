Is it ultimately going to be a pain when generating the wall that we
have separate models for announcements and events? Post has no objects
managers, so it's not simple to just query all posts. We may have to do
a merge of the event and announcements lists for display on the wall. Maybe
this would not be necessary if posts were not abstract?

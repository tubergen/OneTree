ssh m@onetree.princeton.edu
password: 1netree

issue:
 git clone git@github.com:tubergen/OneTree.git temp_dir

just sign on under m. then clone into some directory of your own, and go to /var/www/OneTree and 

sudo cp -r ~/temp_dir/* .

then to make sure you don't have the wrong django.wsgi, just do "sudo cp ../django.wsgi ." while you're still in the /var/www/OneTree folder

to clone, password is: passphrase

may have to restart apache:
sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart

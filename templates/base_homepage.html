        <div class="container-top-bar"><strong>Welcome to OneTree!</strong> The new way to organize communities.</div>
        <h3>What is this place?</h3>
        <div class="explanation">OneTree is a brand new site that helps you explore your community by organizing all the sub-communities that comprise it.</div>
        <h3>How does it work?</h3>
        <div class="explanation">Imagine the Princeton community: it itself is comprised of sub-communities like "Arts" and "Sports," which in term are comprised of many smaller sub-communities.</div>
        <div class="explanation-image"><img src="/static/images/explanation.gif" width="280px" height="300px" /></div>
        <div class="explanation">If you're curious about what's going on at Princeton, you might as well aggregate everything going on in all its sub-communities. Or if you're interested in only the arts at Princeton, you can aggregate all of its sub-communities.</div>
        <div class="explanation">OneTree lets you do just that: by visiting any community page, you'll instantly see announcements and events of <em>all</em> sub-communities that comprise it.</div>
        <h3>What next?</h3>
        <div class="explanation">Explore the site, or go <a href="/user-signup/">make an account!</a> And please don't hesitate to <a href="">send us feedback</a> (link coming soon =P) -- we're working hard to improve this site!</div>
    </div>

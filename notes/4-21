a manager for notifications might be useful for things like

pending_mem_req = MembershipReq.objects.filter(sender=request.user,
		group = group, pending=True)

^in common/user.py this query is needlessly inefficent i htink

users should be logged in when they reigster; they just shouldn't be allowed to do stuff

wherever I have a wall, I'm going to need to send in this post_vote object, for instance. annoying eh/

confusing error message if you're creating an account that already exists

still not logged in after registering

unhandled error page if i create duplicate events

if i'm not logged in, and i go to the "http://onetree.princeton.edu/" page, and
there are no groups
i get: Sorry, there are no groups yet. Why don't you go ahead and make one

^ but it's not obvious how tomake one if i'm not logged in

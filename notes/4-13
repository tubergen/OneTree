wherever I have a wall, I'm going to need to send in this post_vote object, for instance. annoying eh/

confusing error message if you're creating an account that already exists

still not logged in after registering

unhandled error page if i create duplicate events (events with same url)
IntegrityError at /group/bob/
(1062, "Duplicate entry 'sdf' for key 'event_url'")

If i do make an error filling out a time field for event creation, can we
make it so that the other fields are auto repopulated with the stuff I entered?


if i'm not logged in, and i go to the "http://onetree.princeton.edu/" page, and
there are no groups,
i get: Sorry, there are no groups yet. Why don't you go ahead and make one

^ but it's not obvious how tomake one if i'm not logged in

Template Hierarchy:

Base.html (site layout)
	  Group Page extends base.html
	  	Includes wall_display.html
			 Includes wall_submit (the post submission form)
			 Includes wall_content (the list of posts)
---

The wall_display.html relies on a very specific directory structure with the 
includes. We should change this. (apply to url a function that uses os.dirname
and that sort of stuff, perhaps)

---

Will having separate models for the announcements and events ultimately make
it annoying, since we can't use posts.objects to get all posts? (Posts is
abstract, so it has no object manager)
